# Project 12 - Front-end Sportee Dashboard

This repo contains all the source code to run the micro API for the sports analytics dashboard SportSee.

**1. General information**

To start this project, you are free to use Docker or not. In this documentation, we will see several methods to launch the project easily.

**2. Prerequisites**

I advise : 
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for more zease of use

Or :
- [NodeJS (**version 12.18**)](https://nodejs.org/en/) but be careful you need to change the version of NodJS to "12.18". Actualy the last version of NodJS is "16.16". If you are working with several versions of NodeJS, we recommend you install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). However this tool is not optimized I find.

- Fork the repository
- Clone it on your computer.
- The `yarn` command will allow you to install the dependencies.
- The `yarn dev` command will allow you to run the micro API.
